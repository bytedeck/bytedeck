      instructions: |
        Review the following code using Python Django. Ensure that:
          - Ensure each method has a clear, detailed docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values. Enhance existing docstrings for clarity and completeness.
          - Do not suggest adding type annotations.
          - Review Django querysets for potential performance improvements and suggest optimizations where applicable.
          - Ensure that for every model.save() there is a model.full_clean() that precedes it.
          - Avoid adding generic exception handling (e.g., `except Exception`) in test files. Each test failure should be addressed by the developer with specific exception handling or fixes.
          - Avoid adding comments relating to importing modules.
    - path: "tests/*.py"
      instructions: |
        - There is no sensitive information in the test files. All data handled is procedural/generic and non-sensitive.
